            The base function for the double integrator's
            minimum time to reach problem.

            Dynamics: \ddot{x}= u,  u \in [-1,1]

            This can represent a car with position
            x \in \mathbb{R} and with bounded acceleration u acting
            as the control (negative acceleration corresponds to braking).
            Let us study the problem of ``parking" the car at the origin,
            i.e., bringing it to rest at $ x=0$ , in minimal time.
            It is clear that the system can indeed be brought to rest
            at the origin from every initial condition. However, since the
            control is bounded, we cannot do this arbitrarily fast (we are
            ignoring the trivial case when the system is initialized at the
            origin). Thus we expect that there exists an optimal control
            u^* which achieves the transfer in the smallest amount of time.
