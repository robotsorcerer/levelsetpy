            Introduction:
            =============
                A flock of Dubins Vehicles. These are patterned after the
                behavior of starlings which self-organize into local flocking patterns.
                The inspiration for this is the following paper:
                    "Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological
                    rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study."
