         Splits a high-dimensional grid to a number of lower-dimensional Grids
         See splitGrid_test() for an example

     Inp.ts:
         g - original grid
         dims - cell vector of output grid dimensions
                  eg. dims = {[1; 3], [2; 4]} would produce two 2D sets of Grids.
                      The first set has dimensions corresponding to the 1st and
                      3rd dimensions in the original grid
         bounds - list of bounds of the smaller Grids. This should be a g.dim
                  dimensional matrix that specifies the "grid" of bounds.
             Example 1: suppose the original grid is a [-1, 1]^2 grid in 2D, and
                 dims = {[1 2]} (i.e. no lower-dimesional Grids are created; all
                 Grids remain in 2D). Then, the following bounds would split it
                 into [-1, 0]^2, [0, 1]^2, [-1, 0] x [0, 1], and [0, 1] x [-1, 0]
                 Grids:
                     bounds = {[-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1]};
             Example 2: Suppose the original grid is a [-1, 1]^2 grid in 2D, and
                 dims = {[1], [2]} (i.e. split the grid into one-dimensional
                 Grids). Then the following bounds would split it into [-1, 0], [0,
                 1] Grids in the first dimension, and [-1, 0], [0, 1] Grids in the
                 second dimension:
                     bounds = {[-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1]};

         padding - amount of overlap between two adjacent subGrids

     Output:
       gs - cell vector of Grids
     """

    if not padding:
        padding = 0.05 * (g.max - g.min);

    # Separate the grid into different dimensions
    gs_temp = sepGrid(g, dims);

    # For each dimension, split the grid according to bounds
