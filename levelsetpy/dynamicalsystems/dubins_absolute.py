            Dubins Vehicle Dynamics in absolute coordinates.

            Dynamics:

            ===========
                grid: an np.meshgrid state space on which we are
                resolving this vehicular dynamics. This grid does not have
                a value function (yet!) until it's part of a flock
                u_bound: absolute value of the linear speed of the vehicle.
                w_bound: absolute value of the angular speed of the vehicle.
                init_state: initial position and orientation of a bird on the grid
                rw_cov: random covariance scalar for initiating the stochasticity
                on the grid.
                center: location of this bird's value function on the grid
                axis_align: periodic dimension on the grid to be created
                neigh_rad: neighboring radius that defines the circle where nearest neighbors are counted.
