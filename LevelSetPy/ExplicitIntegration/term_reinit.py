def termReinit(t, y, schemeData):
    """
     termReinit: a Godunov solver for the reinitialization HJ PDE.

     [ ydot, stepBound, schemeData ] = termReinit(t, y, schemeData)

     Computes a Godunov approximation to motion by the reinitialization
     equation.  While the reinitialization equation is a general nonlinear HJ
     PDE, such a Godunov approximation is the least dissipative monotone
     approximation (less dissipative than Roe-Fix or Lax-Friedrichs).  The
     reinitialization equation is

                D_t \phi = -sign(\phi_0)(\|\grad \phi\| - 1).

     where phi_0 is the initial conditions.  Solving the reinitialization
     equation turns an implicit surface function into a signed distance
     function.  It is iterative, and often slower than a fast marching method
     however, it can use high order approximations and can start directly from
     the implicit surface function without needing to explicitly find the
     implicit surface (although the subcell fix discussed below does in some
     sense find the surface).

     The term and concept of reinitialization was originally proposed by Chopp
     in 1993, but the reinitialization PDE used here comes from

       M. Sussman, P. Smereka & S. Osher, "A Level Set Method for Computing
       Solutions to Incompressible Two Phase Flow," J. Computational Physics,
       v. 119, pp. 145-159 (1994).

     It is discussed in O&F chapter 7.4.  The translation between the
     parameters of this function and the notation in O&F,

       data = y	  \phi, reshaped to vector form.
       derivFunc	  Function to calculate phi_i^+-.
       initial	  \phi_0
       delta = ydot  -S(\phi_0)(|\grad \phi| - 1)

     The Gudonov solver used below comes from from appendix A.3 of

       R. Fedkiw, T. Aslam, B. Merriman & S. Osher, "A Non-Oscillatory
       Eulerian Approach to Interfaces in Multimaterial Flows (the Ghost
       Fluid Method)," J. Computational Physics, v. 152, pp. 457-492 (1999).

     The subcell fix option is implemented based on

       Giovanni Russo & Peter Smereka, "A Remark on Computing Distance
       Functions," J. Computational Physics, v. 163, pp. 51-67 (2000),
       doi:10.1006/jeph.2000.6553

     Note that Russo & Smereka is based on the schemes from Sussman, Smereka &
     Osher and Sussman & Fatemi (1999), which may not be identical to Fedkiw,
     Aslam, Merriman & Osher.

     The smoothed sgn() approximation is given in the subfunction smearedSign.
     Note that if the subcell fix is applied, the smoothed sgn() function is
     not used (although a similar smoothing is implicitly applied).

     Inp.t Parameters:

       t: Time at beginning of timestep.

       y: Data array in vector form.

       schemeData:	A structure (see below).

     Output Parameters:

       ydot: Change in the data array, in vector form.

       stepBound: CFL bound on timestep for stability.

       schemeData: The same as the inp.t argument (unmodified).

     The parameter schemeData is a structure containing data specific to this
     type of term approximation.  For this function it contains the field(s)

       .grid: Grid structure (see processGrid.m for details).

       .derivFunc: Function handle to upwinded finite difference derivative
       approximation.

       .initial: Array, same size as data.  Initial implicit surface function
       (used to determine on which side of surface node should lie).
       Consequently, on the first reinitialization timestep, this array should
       be equal to data.

       .subcell_fix_order: Integer.  Specifies whether to apply the subcell fix
       from Russo & Smereka to nodes near the interface, and if the fix is
       applied specifies what order of accuracy to use.  Specify order 0 to
       turn off the fix.  At present, only orders 0 and 1 are supported.
       Optional.  Default = 1.

     The schemeData structure may contain addition fields at the user's
     discretion.

     For evolving vector level sets, y may be a cell vector.  If y is a cell
     vector, schemeData may be a cell vector of equal length.  In this case all
     the elements of y (and schemeData if necessary) are ignored except the
     first.
