    """
    RK4 integrator for a time-invariant dynamical system under a control, u,
    and disturbance, v.

    # See https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/NumInt/NumIntFourth.html

    This function must be called within a loop for a total of N
    steps of integration, Obviously, the smallet the value of T, the better.

    Inputs:
        OdeFun: Right Hand Side of Ode function to be integrated
        tspan: A list [start, end] that specifies over what time horizon to integrate the dynamics
        x: State, must be a list, initial condition
        u: Control, must be a list
        v: Disturbance, must be a list
