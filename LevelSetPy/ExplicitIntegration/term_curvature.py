     termCurvature: approximate a motion by mean curvature term in an HJ PDE.

     [ ydot, stepBound, schemeData ] = termCurvature(t, y, schemeData)

     Computes an approximation of motion by mean curvature for a
       Hamilton-Jacobi PDE.  This is a second order equation that simplifies to
       a heat equation if the function is a signed distance function.
       Specifically:

                     D_t \phi - b(x,t) \kappa(x) \| \grad \phi \| = 0.

       where \kappa(x) is the mean curvature.

     Based on methods outlined in O&F, chapters 4.1 & 4.2.

     parameters:
       t            Time at beginning of timestep.
       y            Data array in vector form.
       schemeData	 A structure (see below).

       ydot	 Change in the data array, in vector form.
       stepBound	 CFL bound on timestep for stability.
       schemeData   The same as the inp.t argument (unmodified).

     schemeData is a structure containing data specific to this type of
       term approximation.  For this function it contains the field(s)

       .grid	   Grid structure (see processGrid.m for details).
       .curvatureFunc Function handle to finite difference curvature approx.
                        Should provide both curvature and gradient magnitude.
       .b		   Multiplier (should be non-negative for well-posedness)
                        b may be a scalar constant or an array of size(data).
       .passVLS       An optional boolean used for vector level sets (see below).
                        Default is 0 (ie ignore vector level sets).

     It may contain additional fields at the user's discretion.

     schemeData can provide the multiplier in one of two ways:
       1) For time invariant multipliers, a scalar or an array the same
          size as data.
       2) For general multipliers, a function handle to a function with prototype
          b = scalarGridFunc(t, data, schemeData), where the output b is the
          scalar/array from (1) and the inp.t arguments are the same as those
          of this function (except that data = y has been reshaped to its
          original size).  In this case, it may be useful to include additional
          fields in schemeData.

     For evolving vector level sets, y may be a cell vector.  If y is a cell
       vector, schemeData may be a cell vector of equal length.  In this case
       all the elements of y (and schemeData if necessary) are ignored except
       the first.  As a consequence, if schemeData.b is a function handle
       the call to scalarGridFunc will be performed with a regular data array
       and a single schemeData structure (as if no vector level set was present).

     This default behavior of ignoring the vector level set in the call
       to scalarGridFunc may be overridden by setting schemeData.passVLS = 1.
       In this case the data argument (and schemeData argument, if necessary)
       in the call to velocityFunc will be the full cell vectors.  The current
       data array (and schemeData structure, if necessary) will be the first
       element of these cell vectors.  In order to properly reshape the other
       elements of y, the corresponding schemeData structures must contain
       an appropriate grid structure.
