     curvatureSecond: second order centered difference approx of the curvature.

       [ curvature, gradMag ] = curvatureSecond(grid, data)

     Computes a second order centered difference approximation to the curvature.

           \kappa = divergence(\grad \phi / | \grad \phi |)

     See O&F section 1.4 for more details.  In particular, this routine
       implements equation 1.8 for calculating \kappa.

     parameters:
       grid	Grid structure (see processGrid.m for details).
       data        Data array.

       curvature   Curvature approximation (same size as data).
       gradMag	Magnitude of gradient |\grad \phi|
                     Incidentally calculated while finding curvature,
                     also second order centered difference.
