def cells_from_grid(g, bounds, padding=None):
    """
     gs = cells_from_grid(g, bounds, padding)
         Splits the grid into smaller grids, each with specified bounds.
         Optionally, padding can be specified so that the grids overlap

     Inp.ts:
         g      - original grid
         bounds - list of bounds of the smaller grids. This should be a g.dim
                  dimensional matrix that specifies the "grid" of bounds.
             For example, suppose the original grid is a [-1, 1]^2 grid in 2D.
             Then, the following bounds would split it into [-1, 0]^2, [0, 1]^2,
             [-1, 0] x [0, 1], and [0, 1] x [-1, 0] grids:
                 bounds = {[-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1]};
         padding - amount of overlap between two adjacent subgrids

     Output:
         gs - subgrids
