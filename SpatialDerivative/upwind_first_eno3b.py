     upwindFirstENO3b: third order upwind approx of first deriv by direct calc.

       [ derivL, derivR ] = upwindFirstENO3b(grid, data, dim, generateAll)

     Computes a third order directional approximation to the first
       derivative, using an Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) approximation.

     The approximation is constructed by the equations in O&F, section 3.4
       equations (3.25) - (3.27).  This is an
       alternative to the more efficient divided difference
       table for computing the ENO approximations, which is used in
       upwindFirstENO3a.  In particular, the left and right approximations
       are computed independently in this version.

     The generateAll option is used for debugging, and possibly by
       higher order weighting schemes.  Under normal circumstances
       the default (generateAll = false) should be used.

     parameters:
       grid	Grid structure (see processGrid.m for details).
       data        Data array.
       dim         Which dimension to compute derivative on.
       generateAll Return all possible third order upwind approximations.
                     If this boolean is true, then derivL and derivR will
                     be cell vectors containing all the approximations
                     instead of just the ENO approximation.  Note that
                     the ordering of these approximations may not be
                     consistent between upwindFirstENO1 and upwindFirstENO2.
                     (optional, default = 0)

       derivL      Left approximation of first derivative (same size as data).
       derivR      Right approximation of first derivative (same size as data).
