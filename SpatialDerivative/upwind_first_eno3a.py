     upwindFirstENO3a: third order upwind approx of first deriv by divided diffs.

       [ derivL, derivR ] = upwindFirstENO3a(grid, data, dim, generateAll)

     Computes a third order directional approximation to the first
       derivative, using an Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) approximation.

     The approximation is constructed by a divided difference table,
       which is more efficient (although a little more complicated)
       than using the direct equations from O&F section 3.4
       (see upwindFirstENO3b for that version).

     Details of this scheme can be found in O&F, section 3.3,
       where this scheme is equivalent to including the Q_1, Q_2 and Q_3
       terms of the ENO approximation.

     The generateAll option is used for debugging, and possibly by
       higher order weighting schemes.  Under normal circumstances
       the default (generateAll = false) should be used.

     parameters:
       grid	Grid structure (see processGrid.m for details).
       data        Data array.
       dim         Which dimension to compute derivative on.
       generateAll Return all possible third order upwind approximations.
                     If this boolean is true, then derivL and derivR will
                     be cell vectors containing all the approximations
                     instead of just the ENO approximation.
                     (optional, default = 0)

       derivL      Left approximation of first derivative (same size as data).
       derivR      Right approximation of first derivative (same size as data).
