     upwindFirstENO3aHelper: helper function for upwindFirstENO3a.

       [ dL, dR, DD ] = upwindFirstENO3aHelper(grid, data, dim, approx4, stripDD)

     Helper function to compute the ENO and WENO directional approximations
       to the first derivative using a divided difference table.

     The approximation is constructed by a divided difference table,
       which is more efficient (although a little more complicated)
       than using the direct equations from O&F section 3.4
       (see upwindFirstENO3b for that version).

     Details of this scheme can be found in O&F, section 3.3,
       where this scheme is equivalent to including the Q_1, Q_2 and Q_3
       terms of the ENO approximation.

     Parameters
     ==========
      grid:      Grid Bundle.
      data:      Data array (Value Function).
      dim:       Which dimension to compute derivative on.
      approx4:   Generate two copies of middle approximation using
                 both left/right and right/left traversal of divided
                 difference tree.  The extra copy is placed in the
                 fourth element of derivL and derivR, and is equivalent
                to the version in the second element of those lists.
      stripDD:  Strip the divided difference tables down to their
                     appropriate size, otherwise they will contain entries
                     (at the D1 and D2 levels) that correspond entirely
                     to ghost lists.
      Returns
      =======
       dL:      List containing the 3 or 4 left approximations
                     of the first derivative (each the same size as data).
       dR:      List containing the 3 or 4 right approximations
                     of the first derivative (each the same size as data).
       DD:      List containing the divided difference tables
                     (optional).
