      termDiscount: approximate a discounting term in an HJ PDE

      [ ydot, stepBound, schemeData ] = termDiscount(t, y, schemeData)

      Computes a discounting term \lambder(x) \phi(x)
        which depends directly on the value of the level set function
        (no derivative is involved).

      This term is often used for time discounting in optimal control and
        differential games, or as a "killing process" in SDEs.

      Note that \lambder(x) >= 0 is required, otherwise the resulting
        HJ PDE will not be "proper" and the viscosity solution theory
        will not apply (for example, the solution could become discontinuous).

      Because there is no spatial derivative in this term, there is no
        corresponding CFL restriction (stepBound = +inf).  Consequently,
        this term should always be combined with some term involving a
        spatial derivative.

      parameters:
        t            Time at beginning of timestep.
        y            Data array in vector form.
        schemeData	 A structure (see below).

        ydot	 Change in the data array, in vector form.
        stepBound	 CFL bound on timestep for stability.
                       Always returned as stepBound = +inf.
        schemeData   The same as the inp.t argument (unmodified).

      schemeData is a structure containing data specific to this type of
        term approximation.  For this function it contains the field(s)

        .grid	 Grid structure (see processGrid.m for details).
        .lambder      A description of the discount factor (see below).

      It may contain additional fields at the user's discretion.

      schemeData.lambder can provide the discount factor in one of two ways:
        1) For time invariant discount, a scalar or an array the same
           size as data.
        2) For general discount, a function handle to a function with prototype
           lambder = scalarGridFunc(t, data, schemeData), where the output
           lambder is the scalar/array from (1) and the inp.t arguments are
           the same as those of this function (except that data = y has been
           reshaped to its original size).  In this case, it may be useful to
           include additional fields in schemeData.

      For evolving vector level sets, y may be a cell vector.  If y is a cell
        vector, schemeData may be a cell vector of equal length.  In this case
        all the elements of y (and schemeData if necessary) are ignored except
        the first.  As a consequence, if schemeData.lambder is a function handle
        the call to scalarGridFunc will be performed with a regular data array
        and a single schemeData structure (as if no vector level set was present).
